# 📊 IndoBERT-Based Sentiment Analysis on Indonesian Stock News

This repository contains the complete implementation of a sentiment analysis project using **IndoBERT** from **[IndoNLU](https://github.com/IndoNLP/indonlu)** framework. The research focuses on classifying Indonesian stock news headlines from **CNBC Indonesia** into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiments.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository contains two main folders:

- `Dataset/`: Contains the original and split datasets (ratios 90:10, 80:20, 70:30), along with preprocessed CSV files.
- `Codes/`: Includes Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing and sentiment analysis.

---

## 📚 Overview

- **Model**: IndoBERT-Large (`indobenchmark/indobert-large-p2`)
- **Framework**: IndoNLU
- **Dataset size**: 9,819 headlines
- **Sentiment classes**: `positif`, `netral`, `negatif`
- **Data source**: CNBC Indonesia Market section (2024–2025)

This repository supports reproducible experimentation using stratified shuffle split and includes multiple learning rate scenarios and early stopping configuration.

## 🧪 Key Features

- ✅ Fine-tuned IndoBERT for text classification in Bahasa Indonesia
- ✅ Manual sentiment labeling on stock news headlines
- ✅ Dataset split optimization using **Jaccard Similarity**
- ✅ Four learning rate configurations (2e-5, 3e-5, 2e-6, 3e-6)
- ✅ Early stopping based training control
- ✅ Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ✅ Reproducibility with random seed and controlled split
